"""
If a thread needs to know immediately when a consumer thread has processed a particular
item of data, you should pair the sent data with an Event object that allows the
producer to monitor its progress.

One caution with thread queues is that putting an item in a queue doesnâ€™t make a copy
of the item. Thus, communication actually involves passing an object reference between
threads. If you are concerned about shared state, it may make sense to only pass im
mutable
data structures (e.g., integers, strings, or tuples) or to make deep copies of the
queued items.
