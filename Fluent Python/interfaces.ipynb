    "## Interfaces and Protocols in Python Culture\n",
    "\n",
    "***Protocols** are defined as the informal interfaces that make polymorphism work in languages with dynamic typing\n",
    "like Python*.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do interfaces work in a dynamic-typed language? First, the basics: even without an interface keyword in the anguage, and regardless of ABCs, every class has an interface: the set public attributes (methods or data attributes) implemented or inherited by the class. This includes special methods, like `__getitem__` or `__add__`.\n",
    "\n",
    "By definition, protected and private attributes are not part of an interface, even if “protected” is merely a naming convention and private attributes are easily accessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, it’s not a sin to have public data attributes as part of the interface of an object, because—if necessary—a data attribute can always be turned into a property implementing `getter`/`setter` logic without breaking client code that uses the plain `obj.attr` syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "A useful complementary definition of **interface** is: *the subset of an object’s public methods that enable it to play a specific role in the system*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Protocols are interfaces, but because they are informal—defined only by documentation and conventions—protocols cannot be enforced like formal interfaces can. A protocol may be partially implemented in a particular class, and that’s OK.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Digs Sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, take a look at the Foo class in Example 11-3. It does not inherit from `abc.Sequence`, and it only implements one method of the sequence protocol: `__getitem__` (`__len__` is missing)."
