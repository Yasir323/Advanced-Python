    When using queues, it can be somewhat tricky to coordinate the
    shutdown of the producer and consumer.

    A common solution to this problem is to rely on a special sentinel
    value, which when placed in the queue, causes consumers to
    terminate as shown in the code below

        object and stops iteration when itâ€™s found. This __iter__ method also
        calls task_done at appropriate times, letting me track the progress of
        work on the queue.
