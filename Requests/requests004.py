# Because the decoding of bytes to a str requires an encoding 
# scheme, requests will try to guess the encoding based on the 
# responseâ€™s headers if you do not specify one. You can provide 
# an explicit encoding by setting .encoding before accessing 
# .text:
print(response.encoding)
print(response.text)

# To get a dictionary, you could take the str you retrieved 
# from .text and deserialize it using json.loads(). However, 
# a simpler way to accomplish this task is to use .json():
print(response.json())
