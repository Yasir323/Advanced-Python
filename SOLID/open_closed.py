Open for Extension, Closed for Modification It's now time for the O in SOLID, known as the open-closed principle.
Simply put, classes should be open for extension but closed for modification. In doing so, we stop ourselves from
modifying existing code and causing potential new bugs in an otherwise happy application.

Of course, the one exception to the rule is when fixing bugs in existing code.

Let's explore the concept with a quick code example. As part of a new project, imagine we've implemented a Guitar class.

It's fully fledged and even has a volume knob:
"""


class Guitar:

    __make: str
    __model: str
    __volume: int


"""
We launch the application, and everyone loves it. But after a few months, we decide the Guitar is a little boring 
and could use a cool flame pattern to make it look more rock and roll.

At this point, it might be tempting to just open up the Guitar class and add a flame pattern â€” but who knows what 
errors that might throw up in our application. 

Instead, let's stick to the open-closed principle and simply extend our Guitar class:
"""


class SuperCoolGuitarWithFlames(Guitar):

    __flameColor: str


# By extending the Guitar class, we can be sure that our existing application won't be affected.
